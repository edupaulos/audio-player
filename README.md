# Audio player

This repository contains the source code for the Audio Player challenge proposed by [Significa](https://significa.co/).
You can find more details above.

## Layout Preview
<img width="884" alt="Application Layout" src="UI.png">

You can find the prototype design, which is based on [where](https://www.figma.com/file/jbkDpuET4jQVQmJZqN8Hgd/Dev-challenge---Media-player?type=design&node-id=201%3A4165&t=98lin7BvmyS01ouM-1)

Additionally to the prototype, I added a play icon that you can find in the folder /assets/icons.

## Technologies Used

There are the framework/tools, that were chosen to build the solution:
- [React](https://react.dev/) - used as the main framework to construct the application logic;
- [Vite](https://react.dev/) - used to create the boilerplate and run the project;
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - used to build the project styles quickly;
- [Wavesurfer/react](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer-react) - used to create the waveform of each song and manage the sound playback;
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - used to maintain the application complexity as long as the project grows.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/edupaulos/audio-player.git`;
2. Enter in the project folder: `cd audio-player`;
3. Run `yarn wizard` âœ¨ -> this will install depencencies and run the project;

## Usage
